<h1>Country Hangman</h1>
A simple, unlimited, and randomised game of hangman featuring countries
 <h1 class="title">How To Play</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>You have to guess the mystery country, generated randomly.</li>
            <li>The blanks(_) at the top signify the number of letters in the country's name.</li>
            <li>If the country has more than one word, the words are separated by a slash(/).</li>
            <li>If you think a particular letter is in the answer, click on it, or press the button on the keyboard.</li>
            <li>If it is indeed in the answer, then the position of the letter amongst the other letters and blanks will be shown at the top.</li>
            <li>If, however, that letter is not in the answer, then the picture of the hangman will gain a body part.</li>
            <li>If the picture of the hangman is completed, which will be after seven incorrect guesses, then you lose.</li>
        </ul>
